<!-- Monica Malori -->
<p>Monica Malori</p>
<p>Secretary</p>
<p>My name is Monica and I am a native of Rome, the ‚ÄúEternal City‚Äù.  I come from a multi-cultural background given that my father is Italian, and my mother is Mexican. As a child, that was not easy at times because the education I was receiving was combining the two cultures and I often felt a little out of place compared to my peers. Eventually though, I realized how lucky I was. In my frequent trips to Mexico, I was able to experience different realities, languages and even foods and my exposure to all these elements started contributing to my personal fulfillment and making me feel ‚Äúhappily different‚Äù. The lesson, for sure, was that I learned how to embrace diversity and see possibilities and this simple learning has been a key to enriching, shaping and completing my own life.I am generous and empathetic by nature with a true passion for all living beings (including humans üòä)  I am always available to help the minorities or to fight for a good cause which is one of the reasons  I have jumped at the chance to cooperate with Miss Planet USA and bring my expertise as an Executive Secretary, having worked in that role at Rome‚Äôs largest newspaper for many years.  It‚Äôs a great honor for me to work with an organization that is dedicated to the most noble purpose I can think of, the preservation of our planet to make it a better place for the future generations. Beauty and social commitment holding hands, isn‚Äôt it great? Thanks!Monica Malori</p>
<p>I bring people, ideas, and inspiration together to make the world a better place.</p>
