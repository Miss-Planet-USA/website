Fashion or National Wear. Contestants must be able to project their own personal sense of style. This segment will be conducted very much like a runway fashion show. Fashion attire can be anything the delegate feels represents a currently popular or stylish ensemble.

Interview with judges. Judging criteria: personality, intelligence, knowledge of oneself, energy, volunteer commitment, overall beauty, grooming and fashion sense.
Daily attire (not scored). The daily attire is a way to keep the group uniformed by wearing a specific color or style outfit each day to match the other contestants. For example one day might be pink top and white shorts, the next day is flower dress. We try to keep it simple and not forcing contestants to spend a lot of money on the daily attire as that is not scored.</p>
